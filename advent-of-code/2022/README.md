## Advent of code 2022 solutions in Rust

Hello. This is my solutions for Advent of code 2022 in Rust. I'm using this as a way to learn Rust, so the solutions are not necessarily the most efficient or idiomatic.

## Goals

- Provide a solution for each day
- Revisit and improve solutions as I learn more about Rust
- Learn about Rust project structure, testing, documentation, tooling and error handling
- Learn about Rust's concurrency model and how to use it
- [x] Create a nice development workflow with Jupyter notebooks (no support for autocomplete in notebooks yet :( )
