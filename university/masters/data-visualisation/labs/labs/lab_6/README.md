Multidimensional data: projections:

1) Find principal components of your data (use: Matlab: pca, R: princomp, or other).

2) Make visualizations in two projection.

3) Make the attribute axis representation.

4)  Select the most informative/informative attributes possible according to the shortest / longest axes

5)  Create different subsets of attributes (informative only, non-informative only, no non-informative attributies, etc.) and visualize the data using the nonlinear projection method - MDS

6) Present different visualizations, comment on the result.
