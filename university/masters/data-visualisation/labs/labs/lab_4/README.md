Problem No 4

Goal: calculate distances/similarities of multidimensional objects using following techniques:
a. Manhattan
b. Euclidean
c. Cosine
d. SMC
e. Jaccard

1. Meaningfully apply appropriate distance/similarity techniques to get the most similar subgroup of objects.
2. Comment the results. Are subgroups of similar objects obtained using different techniques are composed of the same objects?
3. For a distance/similarity techniques that cannot be applied to your data, select a test dataset.
