# Goals
Using python and openCV do face recognition method comparison using experimental data.

Face recognition methods to be compared: Eigenfaces, Fisherfaces, Local Binary Pattern. Use the best experimentally found parameters for each method.

1. Evaluate how method parameters affect the recognition quality. Recognition quality is described with a confidence level.

2. Evaluate in which conditions which of the three (Eigenfaces, Fisherfaces, Local Binary Pattern) detects chosen people, using the best experimentally found parameters.

3. For all three methods, find the most optimal threshold values.

# Requirements
- For the experiment use two or more faces and the best parameter values detected in lab 2.
- Data from each experiment should be displayed in tables and graphs. For every parameter use a separate graph, which shows how the parameter affects the confidence level.
- The tables should contain: parameters, how many faces there are, how many are detected correctly/incorrectly/not detected, what is the best threshold. Parameter influence should be evaluated using 10 different values.
- Main results should contain the photos.
- The results section should contain how many and what type of experiments were performed.
- In the results section, provide: a. What parameters hould be used in the methods, to maximise the number of correct detections and to have the least false positives. b. Which method is more trustorthy.
- Every point in the results section should be concrete and correspond to the graphs and tables. It should focus on numbers and figures.

# Notes
- You can't compare confidence values between different methods, because they are calculated differently.
